# MiniMax H3 Audio T8

[简体中文](README.md) | English

A ComfyUI node pack for MiniMax H3 video and audio generation, with reference control, long-video workflows, face refinement, and acceleration tools.

Current version: **1.52.5** · GPL-3.0-or-later

## Features

- Text-to-video, image-to-video, first/last-frame, image/video/audio references, and mixed references
- Independent video/audio dual-clock sampling
- Source-audio preservation, audio references, track mixing, and low-step Audio Refine
- Multi-keyframes, long-video continuation, one-queue serial generation, resume support, and latent upscaling
- Single- and multi-person face refinement, SAM3.1 tracking, and Skin Finish
- Prompt Relay, SPEED, SLA, PDD, and Enhance-A-Video integrations

Nodes marked `Advanced` or `EXP` are advanced or experimental. Start with their bundled workflows.

## Installation

Search for `MiniMax H3 Audio T8` in ComfyUI Manager, install it, and restart ComfyUI.

Manual installation:

```powershell
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/T8mars/comfyui-minimax-h3-audio-T8.git minimax-h3-audio-T8
```

## Quick Start

1. Open [`examples/workflows`](examples/workflows).
2. New users should start with `01-basic-generation` or `02-audio-control`.
3. Drag a JSON workflow into ComfyUI, replace the models and media, then run it.
4. For advanced workflows, read the folder's `README.md` and the NOTE nodes on the canvas.

For one-queue serial long-video generation, use an `In_Node_Long_Video_Loop` workflow from `04-long-video`. Keep using the Background/Accepted workflows when you want to review each segment manually.

For long video with both Prompt Relay and Enhance-A-Video, use `In_Node_Long_Video_Prompt_Relay_EAV_Stock20_Advanced` from the same folder. It uses the native 20-step route and does not use a Turbo LoRA.

## Model Folders

| Model | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| H3 diffusion model | `models/diffusion_models` |
| Text encoder | `models/text_encoders` |
| Video/audio VAE | `models/vae` |
| Turbo, SLA, PDD, and other LoRAs | `models/loras` |
| Latent upscaler | `models/latent_upscale_models` |

Do not mix FL2VA, Ref2VA, pruned, and full base-model variants.

## Common Settings

- Common Turbo dual-clock shifts: video `12`, audio `3`
- Preserve source audio: set `audio_mode=lock_source` and connect `mux_audio` to the save node
- Media tags: `<Picture 1>`, `<Video 1>`, and `<Audio 1>` must match the connected inputs
- Use width and height values divisible by 32; reduce resolution, frame count, and reference count first when VRAM is insufficient
- `1920×1088` is a risk-reference area, not an execution limit; larger canvases warn but are not blocked, and the user accepts the OOM and quality risk
- Do not stack multiple nodes that each take ownership of the sampler, attention, or MODEL forward path

## PDD 8-Step

Workflows are under [`19-pdd-acceleration`](examples/workflows/19-pdd-acceleration). PDD requires its dedicated setup node and must not be loaded as a normal LoRA.

Download the converted FL2VA/Ref2VA PDD acceleration LoRAs from [t8star/MiniMax-H3-Acc-8Step-comfy](https://huggingface.co/t8star/MiniMax-H3-Acc-8Step-comfy), place them in `ComfyUI/models/loras`, and select the variant matching your base model.

Defaults: Euler/simple, 8 NFE, shifts `12 / 3`, CFG 1.

The folder also includes learned-latent two-pass workflows for FL2VA and Ref2VA. They split the same PDD trajectory into LOW 4 steps and HIGH 4 steps, so total NFE remains 8. The validated Ref2VA preset uses 864×480×22 with 1.5× upscale; the FL2VA two-pass route remains experimental.

## Official Core Compatibility

[`20-core-compatibility`](examples/workflows/20-core-compatibility) provides optional AV-latent, H3 Attention Hook, and per-step host-sync compatibility nodes. The tiled-VAE global-coordinate proposal produced stronger grid artifacts in the current fp16 VAE validation, so it remains a report-only, bypass-by-default audit and is not recommended as a fix. Existing workflows do not need changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Shifted parameters or NaN widgets:** fully restart ComfyUI, then reload the workflow.
- **Media-tag error:** check the connected media and tag numbering.
- **Prompt Relay tokenizer error:** use the native `Load CLIP` node with `type=minimax`. Since 1.52.3, wrapped CLIP objects with hidden internal tokenizers are supported only when every token matches native H3 tokenization.
- **Source audio is missing:** use `lock_source` and connect `mux_audio`.
- **OOM:** disable concurrency, lower resolution/frame count, then disable advanced nodes one by one to isolate the cause.
